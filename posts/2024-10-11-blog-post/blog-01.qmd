## National Student Loan Data System

Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-student-loan-data-system-722b0

The National Student Loan data contains information about loans and grants awarded to students under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which refers to federal financial aid programs for post secondary education. The data includes various loan categories like Direct Loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), and Perkins Loans. It spans the entire life cycle of these loans, from disbursement to closure. Most files contain between 10 to 25 columns, with key information such as loan types, disbursement amounts, repayment plans, deferment and forbearance details, and loan statuses. These columns typically include financial metrics like “Dollars Outstanding”, “Recipients”, and “Number of Loans”. The files also vary in terms of row counts; some are relatively small, like summary files with a few hundred rows, while detailed loan or quarterly activity reports contain thousands of rows (ranging from 3798 to 4057 rows). Some files also have additional formatting and metadata rows.

This data was originally collected to centralize and monitor federal student aid, helping policymakers, educational institutions, and borrowers manage financial aid efficiently. Main challenges might include cleaning and consolidating disparate files and handling large amounts of historical data, especially if some files are incomplete or inconsistent in format. Some key questions to consider might include loan default rates over time, trends in deferment or forbearance, and the impact of repayment plans on loan outcomes. Additionally, we can explore how loan activity varies across schools and regions, using the quarterly reports to identify trends in loan disbursements and borrower demographics. Another key question would be how the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs are affecting long-term repayment patterns and loan forgiveness rate across various borrower groups.


## Crash Reporting-Drivers Data

This dataset includes information on vehicles that have been involved in collisions on public and local roads within Montgomery County, Maryland. It includes 39 columns and 186,170 rows or entries, and we are able to clean the data as well as load it into the environment.  It was collected by an Automated Reporting System (ARS) through the Police department and showed each collision recorded as well as the drivers involved. This data may include verified as well as unverified data and is non-federal. 

The main questions we hope to address with this data set include data on road safety, driver behaviors, as well as accident patterns within Montgomery County. We could use response and predictor variables such as location, vehicle model, collision type, and time of day (light) to name a few. Some challenges we could face with this data are the number of entries it holds, as well as many NA entries that were unable to be filled by the ARS. This means cleaning this data could take much longer than anticipated. Additionally, it doesn’t provide variables such as Age or Race which could be helpful indicators to see patterns in possible criminal injustice. Overall this data set is very interesting but it may not be the best of the three for analyzing as well as finding prejudices. 

## Crime Data from 2020 to Present

Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

This dataset contains records of crime incidents in Los Angeles, California, from 2020 until 2024. The dataset was digitized from paper reports originally maintained by the LA Police Department and later transferred to an electronic format. It includes 22 columns and over 200,000 rows of data. Due to digitizing, there may be some discrepancies, such as missing or incomplete data, particularly in location fields. For privacy reasons, locations are only recorded up to the hundredth block rather than specific addresses.

The dataset contains over 200,000 rows and 22 columns, offering detailed information about various incidents, including crime type, date, time, location, and the involved parties. The Los Angeles Police Department originally collected this data as part of routine crime reporting. Initially maintained as paper records, it was later digitized and entered into an electronic database. This data collection aims to track crime incidents across the city for law enforcement purposes, urban planning, and policy analysis. It is also used to inform the public and local authorities about crime trends and patterns in Los Angeles.

The data can be loaded and cleaned, but its large size and missing entries from the transition from paper to digital format may make cleaning time-consuming. Special attention will be needed for missing values, especially in location and categorical fields, and date/time reformatting may be required. Key questions include identifying crime trends from 2020 to 2024, examining neighborhoods with higher crime rates, and finding correlations between crime types and factors like time of day or proximity to locations. Challenges include handling over 200,000 rows, missing location data, and limited precision due to privacy restrictions on location details. Ensuring data consistency after the transition is another potential issue.
