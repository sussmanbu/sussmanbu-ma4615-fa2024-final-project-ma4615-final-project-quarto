# MA 415 Traffic Crash Analysis Project - Montgomery County

Visit our project website: [Group 1 Project Site](https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma-4615-fa24-final-project-group-1/)

## Overview
This project analyzes traffic collision data from Montgomery County, Maryland, as part of the CAS MA 415 Data Science with R course. Our analysis focuses on understanding the complex relationships between road infrastructure, emergency response capabilities, and temporal patterns in traffic safety. The project integrates multiple datasets including crash reports, pavement conditions, and emergency response metrics to provide comprehensive insights into traffic safety factors.

## Research Focus
Our analysis revealed several key findings:
- The relationship between road quality and accidents is non-linear, with most crashes occurring on roads with moderate Pavement Condition Index ratings
- Emergency response capabilities and temporal patterns play significant roles in crash outcomes
- Integration of multiple data sources provides a more nuanced understanding of traffic safety factors
