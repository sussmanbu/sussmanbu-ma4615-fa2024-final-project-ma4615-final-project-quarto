Our data set contains information on every fatal shooting made by a police officer in the US. This data was initially collected since the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. To combat this, our dataset aims to create a more comprehensive picture of police shootings, in what cases they come about, and which demographic groups these shootings tend to involve.

We are using data from `fatal-police-shootings-data.csv` with 14 variables:

* **Id**: Presumably their criminal ID number. It is not specific to the order of the date of the shooting, so I think it is assigned based on another variable.
* **Name**: The name of the person that got shot.
* **Date**: The day they were shot, from January 2015 - June 2020.
* **Manner_of_death**: How they were killed by the police (shot/shot and tasered).
* **Armed**: Whether they were carrying a “weapon” at the time of arrest and shooting.
* **Age**: Age when shot.
* **Gender**: Indicates whether male or female.
* **Race**: 
    - A = Asian
    - W = White
    - H = Hispanic
    - B = Black
    - N = Native American
    - O = Other
* **City**: Location where they were shot.
* **State**: What state the city is in.
* **Signs_of_mental_illness**: Whether or not the person shot was mentally ill.
* **Threat_level**: Indicates whether the police were in a threatened position (attack or other).
* **Flee**: Method of fleeing if they were, or if they weren’t.
* **Body_camera**: Whether the police were using a body camera during the arrest and shooting.

Our dataset was fairly clean when we found it, making it relatively easy to interpret and work with. However, our “Race” variable is given by letters - A, W, H, B, N, and O - so are making an extra column “Race_Full” that has the full names of these variables such as “Asian” instead of “A” and “Native American” instead of “N”.

The cleaned data could be found here: [Download the cleaning script](load_and_clean_data.R)

We do not plan to utilize any packages that haven’t already been covered in class as we feel that we can do a thorough analysis without additional ones.

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Rrename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
  * This page should be self-contained.
